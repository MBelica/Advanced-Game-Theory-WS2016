Advanced Game Theory
===========
This script for the lecture 'Advanced Game Theory' held by Prof. Dr. Puppe at the KIT during winter course 2016/17 was created by students and is therefore unofficial. It contains most likely mistakes (typos, copy errors or comprehension problems) since it is a work in progress - I call on your understanding.

Please submit all improvement and suggestions either via email or push them directly into the script on Github, i.e.
* either directly implemented via pull/push or
* sent by mail (MBelica@hmamail.com).

I'm going to try to implement all notes and suggestions as soon as possible.

**With your help we can create good lecture notes.**
